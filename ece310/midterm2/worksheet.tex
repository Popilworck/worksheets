\section{The very basics}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the relation between the Z-transform and the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform? When is this relation not valid?\\\\

\end{enumerate}

\section{Sampling and DTFTs}
(Let the output of a radio be) Consider a signal given by
$$
x(t) = 2\cos(10\pi t) + \sin(30\pi t)
$$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the nyquist sampling rate of this signal?\\\\
    
 

    \item Let's say the signal is sampled at twice the nyquist rate. What does the discrete-time signal look like for three samples starting at $n=0$? What is the $n$'th sample?\\\\
 
    \item Find the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform of the signal. Plot both the real and imaginary components of the DTFT over the range $(-\pi, \pi)$.\\\\

 


    \item What is the power contained in this signal? Make sure to include units!\\\\


 

    \item If we want to build a low-pass filter to filter out the fastest component of this signal, what is the smallest value of $\omega$ at which the filter can start attenuating? \\\\




    \item Lets say we have a perfect filter to do said filtering. We then amplify the signal such that the magnitude of each component is doubled. How does the power of the signal change?\\\\

    
\end{enumerate}
