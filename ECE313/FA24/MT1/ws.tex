Alex is organizing a focus group to figure out how best he can market his homemade rocket engine. He has a group of 6 women and 6 men. To ensure impartiality, he wants to seat them in such a way that the women and men alternate (the women are not sitting next to another woman and the men are not sitting next to another man). He has to seat them around a round table. How many ways can he seat these people?

Tabish has a gambling addiction and decides he can double EWB's savings by going to a casino. It does not work out in his favor and he ends up 50k in the hole. He has one last shot to recover EWB's money, so he decides to calculate the probability of winning the following games and play the ones where he is most likely to win.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Calculate the probability that the sum of the 4 dice is 6.
    \item Calculate the probability that no more than 2 of the dice show a 2.
    \item Calculate the probability that none of the dice show a 6.
    \item Calculate the probability that all of the dice show a different value.
    \item Calculate the probability that two of the dice show different values.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
    Pramod is trying the quantum immortality experiment. There is a random number generator that generates a 1 with probability $p$ or a 0 with probability $1-p$ every second. If it generates a 1, Pramod dies. Pramod dies after 59 seconds of this experiment. What is the maximum likelihood estimate $\hat{p}_{ML}$ of $p$. (Note: each trial is independent of each other)
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

    Shomik has bet his house, his retirement fund, his cane, and his trenchcoats (in increasing order of importance) to Udit on a series of coin flips. Shomik is sneaky, so he can choose to use an unbiased coin or a weighted coin that lands on heads 60$\%$ of the time. Shomik flips his coin 10 times. For both the biased and fair coin, calculate the probability that it lands on Heads more than it lands on Tails, i.e the probability that Shomik does not lose. 
    \newline
    Shomik flipped his coin 10 times, and it showed heads only 4 times. He now has to give up his prized possessions to Udit. Now destitute and depressed, he decides that he wants to know which coin he chose. Calculate the probability that the fair coin was chosen and the probability that the biased coin was chosen.
    
\end{exercise}

%\begin{exercise}
  %  Let X be the number of times the coin lands on heads and $H_0$ the case where Shomik used a fair coin and $H_1$ is the case where Shomik uses an unfair coin. Calculate the p

Steve the ECE major has procrastinated on his assignment and the code he wrote is not compiling. If he goes to sleep right now the number of bugs in his code, X, can be modeled by a Poisson distribution with a mean $\lambda_1$ = 2. If he pulls an all nighter, X has the Poisson distribution with a parameter of $\lambda_0$ = 6. 
\newline
Design an ML decision rule to decide, based on the observation of X, that determines whether Steve pulled the all nighter or not.
\newline
Suppose Steve did not learn from his mistakes and throughout the semester he pulls all nighters twice as often as going to sleep ($\pi_1$ / $\pi_0$ = 2). Express the MAP decision rule, based on the observation of X, under this new assumption.

\begin{exercise}
Ian ends up playing an old Soviet era board game with some friends. This board game involves rolling a 5 sided die and a 7 sided die to determine how far he moves his babushka across the board. Say the number of spaces he can move is a variable called X. Determine the sample space of X, the magnitude of the sample space, the pmf of X, the support of the pmf of X, the mean of X, and the variance of X.
\newline
Now, let's say we multiply the value of each role of the dice by 3 and add 4. Calculate the new mean and variance of X.

Steve the ECE major has procrastinated on his assignment and the code he wrote is not compiling. If he goes to sleep right now the number of bugs in his code, X, can be modeled by a poisson distribution with a mean lambda1 = 2. If he pulls an all nighter, X, has the Poisson distribution with a parameter of lambda0 = 6. 

Part A:
Design an ML decision rule to decide, based on the observation of X, that determines whether Steve pulled the all nighter or not.

solution: likelihood ratio function (all nighter) : poisson(k, 6) / poisson(k,2) = some function
determine value of k 

Part B: 
Suppose Steve did not learn from his mistakes and throughout the semester he pulls all nighters twice as often as going to sleep. (pi1 / pi0 = 2) Express the MAP decision rule, based on the observation of X, under this new assumption. 

solution: same thing but you take the frequency into account when finding the likelihood ratio function




A level 99 archer tower is shooting arrows at an invading army. Each arrow always hits its target and the probability of hitting a barbarian or a goblin is 50/50. How many arrows does the tower need to shoot such that the probability will be at least 0.8 that the ratio of the barbarians to goblins will be between 0.3 and 0.7. (Hint: Use Chebychev's inequality.)

Solultion: Let X/n represent the proportion of barbarians killed in battle. Thus E[x] = n*p = n/2, Var(X) = n*p*q = n/4
P(0.3 <= X/n <= 0.7) >= 0.8
P(0.3-0.5 <= X/n-0.5 <= 0.7-0.5) >= 0.8
P(-0.2 <= X/n-0.5 <= 0.2) >= 0.8
P(|X/n-0.5| <= 0.2) >= 0.8
Given that Var(X/n) = 1/n^2 Var(X) = 1/4n
0.8 = 1-1/k^2, where k*oemga = 0.2


The probability of surviving a night at Circle-K is 20%. Suppose you spend 5 nights at Circle-K. Find a bound for the probability that you survive at least 3 nights. (Hint: Use Markov's Inequality)

Solution: Let X be the number of nights you survive. Given that n = 5, p = 0.2, E[x] = 1. Required Probability : P(X >= 3) <= E[X]/3 = 1/3
